## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Javascript



### What I learned
This is my first Javascirpt project  I learned alot of things  like :
>Blur event 
>keydown event 




### Continued development

I recently completed my first JavaScript project, and it was quite a learning experience for me. It took me some time and effort to finish the project.Through this project, I learned a lot of new things about JavaScript and gained valuable hands-on experience.
 I plan to continue working on more projects to become even more comfortable with the language and deepen my understanding of its concepts.
